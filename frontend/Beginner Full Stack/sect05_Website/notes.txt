Rules of web design:
    1. Start off building for desktop
    2. As one element is finished, then tweak it right then and there for Mobile use.
    3. Then work on the next element of the site

    This makes sure you don't overlook anything, preventing you from having to come back later and jump into code that you messed with days, if not weeks ago.
    ---It prevents it from getting so messy and doing overlaps, etc.  It helps you tackle it as needed and keeps everything organized.
- This makes sure each item collapses correctly, making your workflow much easier.

CLASS vs ID:
    If any style properties are to be added, use a CLASS
    Do not apply style properties to IDs, it is a bad practice.
    ####### IDs main use is to interact with JavaScript, nothing more ######

Any time JavaScript is used, reference an external file.  In this webpage, however, we will use in-line code for easy reading.
